# Coursera Data Cleaning Class Project

This repository contains two key files:  
* run_analysis.R - the script that performs the data cleaning tasks described below.
* Dictionary.txt - the code book file that describes the variable names in the tables generated by the script. 

The script performs the following actions:  

1. Loads the UCI data set (downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
